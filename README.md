# BlueBuTter
Basic codeset for Butter GPIO.   
This Git contains a simple code set to enable the first iteration of BuTter GPIO to work with basic Android and iOS apps. The apps will be available on Google play store and the Apple app store once we get them written. The code set and apps allow the experimenter to: 
  - configure the Bluetooth serial port on BlueBuTter, 
  - configure the GPIO port on BlueBuTter, and 
  - read and write the BlueBuTter GPIO port.
    
   
NOTE that the BlueBuTter branch is for the initial prototype hardware, and WILL NOT WORK with the release version because the hardware is different. How can you tell if you have a Bluebutter board? It's BLUE! (Normal BuTter boards are Yellow).
