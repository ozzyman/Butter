# BuTter
Basic codeset for BuTter GPIO.   
This Git contains a simple code set to enable BuTter GPIO to work with basic Android and iOS apps. The apps will be available on Google play store and the Apple app store once we getthem written. The code set and apps allow the experimenter to: 
  - configure the Bluetooth serial port on BuTter,
  - Set up AES security on the Bluetooth link,
  - configure the GPIO port services on BuTter, and 
  - read and write the GPIO port.
